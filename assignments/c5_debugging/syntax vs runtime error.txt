A syntax error in python occurs when it can't understand what you are saying.
example: print 'Hello World'
Python canâ€™t understand this print statement since print method requires brackets 
around the string to print i.e. print('Hello World')

A run-time error in python occurs when it understands what you are saying but runs into error when executing the instruction. 
example: print(1/0)
The syntax here is correct and Python will execute the instruction. 
However, when executing, it will run into error since dividing by zero makes no sense in mathematics.
